Welcome to my online portfolio!

I am currently hard at work developing my personal portfolio. You can take a sneak peek at the work in progress by visiting https://julioandrescastanedamillan.com/. In this initial stage, my focus is on designing and developing the front-end for the web version. I'm excited to share my experience and projects with you.

Please note that I am actively working to optimize the experience for mobile devices, so soon you'll be able to enjoy a mobile-friendly version of my portfolio.

It's important to highlight that the page's content is dynamic and is powered by an API I developed in PHP. This allows me to keep information up-to-date and easily manageable.

I appreciate your patience and hope you enjoy exploring my continually evolving work. Feel free to come back soon to see the latest updates!

Thank you for your interest!

Sincerely,
